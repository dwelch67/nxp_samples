This is like the prior example except this is a 15 bit Sony SIRC
protocol.  

It has a 2.4ms start pulse, and the ones and zeros are encoded in
the pulses, long and short.  a one is 1.2ms and a zero is 0.6 ms.
The pulses are gapped by 0.6ms spaces.

There are 12, 15 and 20 bit versions.  I have an AIWA car stereo
remote control that is 15 bit.
