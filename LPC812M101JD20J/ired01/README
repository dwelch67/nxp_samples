See the ired00 README first.

Your first ired entetainment should start with echoing the infrared
using your visible led.  Connect power and ground to the IR recivier.

Connect the output of the receiver to P0_7 on the mcu.

If you have not used a scope or other to "see" the signal you are
likely to simply echo the signal:

		if(ra&1<<7) PUT32(GPIOSETP0,(1<<14));
		else		PUT32(GPIOCLRP0,(1<<14));
		
And that is perfectly fine.  With this one and I expect in general
but YMMV is that when there is no obvious IR in the room the visible
led will be on.  When you point an IR remote at the receiver and
press buttons or press and hold then the led will blink off but go
back to on when idle.  This is very important to begin decoding because
we need to know if the first pulse from the receiver is a falling edge
or rising edge.  The whole decode starts from there and if you have
it upside down your decoder wont work.

In this example I inverted the signal so the led is normally off

		if(ra&1<<7) PUT32(GPIOCLRP0,(1<<14));
		else		PUT32(GPIOSETP0,(1<<14));
		
So long as it works with a 3.3v mcu and it is a receiver not just a 
diode that you have to pass through a filter, amplifier, whatever
yourself, you can use whichever one you can find.  The examples here
are not specific to the ir receiver.
