baud rate math is a bit funky, but interesting.

12000000 /(16 * 10 * (1+(244/256))) = 38400 exactly
reg 10-1 mul 244 38400.000000 0.000000

The multiply register is as is 244, the two division registers
are n-1 so 10-1 and 256-1.

with my tool can start baud divisor at 1 or at clk/(16 * baud)

12000000 /(16 * 4 * (1+(161/256))) = 115108
reg 4-1 mul 161 115107.913669 92.086331

reg 6-1 mul 22 115107.913669 92.086331

You can basically start with

clk / (16*baud)
12000000/ (16*115200) = 6.5

so uart BRG register is 6-1.

Then

16 * 6 * 115200 = 11059200

12000000/11059200 = 1.0850694444

 21/256 = 0.082031
 22/256 = 0.085938 <-
 23/256 = 0.089844

so then

12000000 /(16 * 6 * (1+(22/256))) = 115108

basically they have this fractional divisor up front that gives you
clk divided by somewhere between a little over 1 to a little under 2.

1+   1/256 = 1.003906
1+   2/256 = 1.007812
1+   3/256 = 1.011719
...
1+ 253/256 = 1.988281
1+ 254/256 = 1.992188
1+ 255/256 = 1.996094

and then you do a whole number division of that.

Important to remember that both the 256 divisor and the brg register
divisor are n-1.  I think there is a bug in the bootloader for 38400
which lead me to think that the brg was not n-1 and I struggled getting
this math to work properly.

(If you use the uart bootloader and load a program to ram then uart is
left programmed and working.  Can dump the registers to see how they
left it).
