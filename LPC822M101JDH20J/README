I bought a handful of LPC822M101JDH20J parts and soldered them to
a breakout board.

tssop20breakout.brd

I went to https://oshpark.com uploaded the brd file and as of this
writing

Detected 2 layer board of 0.75x1.05 inches (19x27mm). $3.90 for three.

Someday I hope to make a video or pictures soldering as it really
isnt that hard, you CAN do it...


This is a WIP.  Trying to figure out the UART in system programming
(ISP).  The good thing is they have a bootloader and strap in that
if you power on with, in this case PIO0_12 grounded, then you go
into the bootloader.  The bad news is that NXP is not consistent
with their bootloaders, some are okay with you just sending a
carriage return, some require a CR/LF.  Some return just a CR and
no LF, some return both.  This part added the joy of not using
uuencoding for the data, and the documentation is wrong.  So still
trying to sort out how to actually write to ram as you have to
write to ram to then copy from ram to flash.   Or maybe the read from
ram command, which appears to do something, is not reading from where
I asked it to read.  I also find it very interesting that the interface
is base 10 based, they dont take addresses or send back values in hex
they use decimal, which means they have extra code in there to do
the conversion to/from decimal.  A bootloader like this should be
purely hex based even if ASCII, makes you wonder...

And you need to reset or power cycle to try again.  for now I am power
cycling.

Bare minimum I only need to power pin 15 with 3.3 and 16 with ground
to turn it on.  pin 6 is U0_TXD and pin 19 is U0_RXD.  since it is
so far still unprogrammed I dont actually have to strap pin 4 to ground
but will if/when I program the flash for the first time.

PIO0_0  U0_RXD

PIO0_12 â€” General-purpose port 0 input/output 12. ISP entry
pin. A LOW level on this pin during reset starts the ISP command
handler.
